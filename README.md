# metaamp
The MetaAmp is designed for analyzing universally conserved phylogenetic marker genes (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA) of metagenomic data. It clusters amplicon reads into OTUs and generates diversity indices and taxonomic composition of the input communities . It accepts single-read or paired-end sequencing in fasta or fastq format from various sequencing platforms.
